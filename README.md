# The Ultimate Guide to Video Production

This GitHub repository is intended to serve as an aggregate for all sorts of data across the internet and to help anyone at any level understand what they need to know for video streaming, recording, production, editing, etc.

### Preface

I've spent a lot of time doing my own little productions with OBS, and each and every time I tried doing it, I always found something that got in my way preventing me from reaching my goal to make a high quality production, whether it be images, overlays, encoding settings, cameras, etc.

My goal with this repo is to take all the information I know and throw it in one place with as many sources as possible, while also letting people check my work, contribute, and to overall provide a very detailed and organized guide for anyone to come and read. 

After getting so fed up trying to help people on [r/OBS](https://www.reddit.com/r/obs/) that don't really know better, this is what I started.
