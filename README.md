# The Ultimate Guide to Video Production

This GitHub repository is intended to serve as an aggregate for all sorts of data across the internet and to help anyone at any level understand what they need to know for video streaming, recording, production, editing, etc.

## Preface

I've spent a lot of time doing my own little productions with OBS, and each and every time I tried doing it, I always found something that got in my way preventing me from reaching my goal to make a high quality production, whether it be images, overlays, encoding settings, cameras, etc.

My goal with this repo is to take all the information I know and throw it in one place with as many sources as possible, while also letting people check my work, contribute, and to overall provide a very detailed and organized guide for anyone to come and read. 

After getting so fed up trying to help people on [r/OBS](https://www.reddit.com/r/obs/) that don't really know better, this is what I started.

## What is Video Production?

[CWM Studios](http://www.cwmstudios.com/98/the-three-phases-of-video-production.html) has a pretty good definition of Video Production: "There are three main processes to putting a video together: pre-production, filming and editing."

However, for all intents and purposes, video production in this article can mean literally anything that has to do with video. Whether it be OBS Studio, video encoding settings, editing software, how to uses these softwares, how Psycho Visual Tuning works, what Node.js and how to use it for overlays, what the heck is a codec?!, what a processors is, what NDI and SSSE3 instructions are, and so on.

This article, at least for the time being, will be mostly focused on OBS Studio, encoding settings, technologies like NDI and new NVENC, how to use basic editing software, why it's important to understand the basics of computer hardware like CPUs (processors), etc.
